JSON is for AI (precise but not readable)

Core Agentic Engine
FastAPI:
Serve Model via API endpoints (It's become very popular for building backend services, especially for ML/AI applications where you need to serve models via API endpoints)
1. Visibility 
2. Validate (API or backend or frontend)
3. JSON (language for AI - precision)

AI need OpenAPI with more precision to conduct the coding.
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight text format for storing and exchanging data. 
It's human-readable and language-agnostic, making it the de facto standard for APIs and configuration files.
It's everywhere — REST APIs return JSON, config files use it, 
and frameworks like FastAPI automatically serialize your Python objects to JSON responses. 
When your agents communicate with each other or with external services, they're almost certainly passing JSON back and forth.
